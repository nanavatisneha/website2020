I absolutely enjoy reading fiction and non-fiction books. You can check out my current reading list on Goodreads. I like following football - specially the English Premier League. I make dope music playlists, can you can find them on Spotify. I try to document my art experiments and local adventures	on my Instagram, do give it a look. :)
